# Sipps
SIPPS is a low-cal beverage brief design brand that requires:

- Brand Identity Design (Adobe Photoshop & Illustrator)
- UX/UI Design (Figma)
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, ReactJs)

There are 2 branches of this project:
- Main (UX/UI Design)
- Master (Web Development)
  
For each part of the project, I've included all the necessary elements that complete the brand. For Brand Identity, we have primary and secondary logos, business cards and packaging design. For UX/UI Design, we've included the wireframes and prototypes of each important page being Home Page, Shop Page and Cart Page. Apart from that, there's also a case study which summarizes the key points of the entire project, which you can find in the UXUI Design folder.
